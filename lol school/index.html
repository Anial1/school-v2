        <p class="text-muted">The school library has over 1,000 novels in both English and Hindi languages. This vast collection of books allows students to explore various genres and subjects according to their interests. Further, reading these books can enhance students' reading comprehension and writing skills while also providing them with a chance to learn about different cultures and societies in the process. For instance, students can read books such as 'Harry Potter', 'The Diary of a Young Girl', and 'The Count of Monte Cristo' to learn about a variety of themes from fantasy to historical fiction. As George R.R. Martin wrote: “A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.” </p>

        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was built in 1982</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">The school auditorium has undergone extensive renovations in recent years. The facility serves as a hub for various events, performances, and gatherings within and beyond the school.
          In recognition of the need for improvement, the school administration has enhanced the auditorium's infrastructure and facilities. To ensure that the upgrades meet the needs of the school community and the community as a whole, the project was carefully planned and executed.
          One of the key objectives of the renovation has been to improve the acoustics of the auditorium. This has been done by installing acoustic panels and other soundproofing measures, resulting in significantly enhanced audio clarity and quality. The improved acoustics not only benefit the performers on stage but also create a more enjoyable experience for the audience.          
          Another focus of the upgrades has been to upgrade the lighting system in the auditorium. The new lighting system not only provides more flexibility and control but also enhances the overall ambience and atmosphere during events. With the ability to adjust the brightness and colour temperature, the auditorium can now accommodate a wide range of performances and activities.
          Additionally, the renovation work has addressed the need for improved accessibility and inclusivity. The auditorium has been retrofitted with wheelchair ramps and elevators, ensuring easy accessibility for all individuals, regardless of their physical abilities. This inclusive design approach promotes equal opportunities for all individuals to enjoy the performances and events that take place within the auditorium.
          Furthermore, the renovation work includes the installation of modern audiovisual equipment. This upgrade allows for the seamless integration of multimedia elements, such as videos, presentations, and visuals, into performances and events. The availability of advanced audiovisual technology enhances the overall experience and engagement of the audience.
          In conclusion, the school auditorium, which has been in existence since 1982, has undergone significant renovations and upgrades in recent years. These improvements have transformed the facility into a modern and well-equipped venue that meets the needs of both the school community and the overall community. With enhanced acoustics, upgraded lighting systems improved accessibility, and state-of-the-art audiovisual technology, the auditorium continues to provide a space for memorable performances and events.</p>
